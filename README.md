# Arduino-IoT-PoC
Introduction

This is a proof of concept for connected office furniture featuring one RFID RCC522 module connected to a Arduino Nano ESP32 getting commands from a RFID card and broadcasting the command through WiFi to a second Arduino Nano ESP32. The first Arduino Nano ESP32 is the command center and the second is a regular device attached to furniture. The storyboard of the proof of concept is this:

# Arduino Nano ESP32

The Nano ESP32 brings the ESP32-S3 to the world of Arduino and MicroPython programming. It uses the well-known Arduino Nano form factor and includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It supports Arduino and MicroPython programming and works (from August 2023 onwards) with Arduino IoT Cloud.
ESP32-S3

The processor used by the board is the u-blox® NORA-W106 (ESP32-S3).

    CPU: Xtensa LX7, 240 MHz dual-core
    RAM: 512 kB
    Flash: 8192 kB

Wi-Fi

The NORA-W106-10B module supports the Wi-Fi® 4 IEEE 802.11 standards b/g/n, with an output power EIRP at up to 10 dBm. The max range for this module is 500 meters.

    802.11b: 11 Mbit/s
    802.11g: 54 Mbit/s
    802.11n: 72 Mbit/s max at HT-20 (20 MHz), 150 Mbit/s max at HT-40 (40 MHz)

Bluetooth

The NORA-W106-10B module supports Bluetooth® LE v5.0 with an output power EIRP at up to 10 dBm and data rates up to 2 Mbps. It has the option to scan and advertise simultaneously, as well as supporting multiple connections in peripheral/central mode.
Pinout

Arduino IDE

Use Arduino IDE 2.x. Go to the Board Manager, and type "esp32" into the search box. Install "esp32 by Arduino". This is different from "esp32 by Espressif". The Arduino-supplied package includes support for the Arduino Nano ESP32.

Make sure you select the Arduino Nano ESP32 with the DFU port, not the COM port. Under Tools->Port pick from the "dfu ports" list, not from "Serial ports".
Read from a potentiometer and publish over MQTT

The middle pin of the potentiometer is connected to pin A0 on the Nano ESP32.

You will also need a arduino_secrets.h file like this:

#define SECRET_SSID "MYWIFINET"
#define SECRET_PASS "secretpassword"
